        <p id = quaketext>Quake, released in 1996, is an influential FPS game often credited with being one of the first esports. It features a single-player loosely story based mode, where players must go through the level, killing monsters and finding the exit, and two multiplayer modes: online co-op, where 2 or more players progress through the campaign together, and Deathmatch, which required physical LAN connections. At Quake's first tournament in 1997, a player named Dennis Fong (username Thresh) won a Ferrari from one of the game's programmers, John Carmack. Fong is often recognized as the world's first professional gamer. </p>

        <p>iD software's Doom, released in 1993, was so anticipated that the University of Wisconsin and many others' network crashed due to so many people trying to download it at once. While Doom wasn't exactly the first FPS game, it certainly pushed the genre into the mainstream. The game features multiple labyrinth-style levels where you must kill enemies to progress to an "exit room" to finish. Basic elements of Doom and Quake, such as deathmatch, the exit rooms, and ammo counters are still present in games today. In fact Doom as a franchise is still releasing games, the most recent game being Doom: The Dark Ages published May of 2025. </p>
