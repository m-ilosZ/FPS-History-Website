        <p>2000's Counter Strike, originally a mod of the game Half-Life, started one of the most popular video game franchises of all time.  The game popularized the "tactical shooter" genre where enemies have a very low "time to kill" and the game features more realistic movement than say, Quake. In CS' core mode Bomb Defusal, two teams of 5, Terrorists and Counter-terrorists, spawn at the same time with pistols. The Ts win a round by either planting the bomb and defending it until it explodes, or eliminating all the CTs either with or without the bomb planted. The CTs win by defusing the bomb or eliminating all the Ts. The first CS game switched sides after 15 rounds and was first to 16 wins the game. Another feature of CS is the economy system. Each team gets money every round in the "buy phase" where they can purchase upgraded weapons such as rifles, snipers, and shotguns.</p>

        <p id = halotext>Halo, an FPS story game realeased for Xbox in 2001 and PCs in 2003, featured some of the best graphics seen at the time and is generally considered one of the best games ever. You play as Master Chief, a super-soldier, fighting the Covenant, a group of alien races who declare a religous war on humanity. Often called one of Halo's best features, the game features multiple drivable vehicles such as armored 4x4 trucks, tanks, and aircrafts. In addition, the game features other human soldiers fighting with you who can mimic the player's movements and man turrets or ride shotgun when controlling a vehicle. Halo also has a split-screen mode which allowed up to four people on the same Xbox to play the campaign together as different characters.
