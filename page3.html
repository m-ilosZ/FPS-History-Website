        <p id = owtext>Blizzard's 2016 FPS Overwatch quickly became one of the most popular games of all time. 8 months after release the game had 25 million players (for comparison, Minecraft had 4 millon after a year) and before Overwatch 2's release in 2021 it had 60 million. Less than 1 year after release Overwatch had sold a billion dollars worth of copies.The game released ith 21 characters, each with unique abilities and one powerful "ultimate" ability. Originally the game had 4 roles, Tank, Offense, Defense, and Support (healer) but this was later changed to just 3, combining Offense and Defense into just one Damage role. Overwatch was 6v6, generally 2 tanks, 2 damage (or offense/defense) and 2 healers but some metas differed. The game had many different maps which each were designed for one mode, being Control, Escort or Hybrid. Control maps were king of the hill style maps with one objective in the middle. Escort maps had the attacking team trying to move a payload through the map to a point in 5 minutes. The payload would stop when defenders were close to it, so the attackers had to fight to move it forward. Hybrid was a mix of the two, where the attackers must take control of a point which then reveals a payload they must escort a shorter distance than in Escort. On both sides, you respawn after a death and can switch character.</p>

        <p>One of the  first true battle royales, PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds (PUBG) released 2017 provided a stark contrast to Overwatch. PUBG's game mechanics are much simpler, without abilities, characters, etc. PUBG's core mode Battle Royale is an evolution of the Deathmatch modes seen in 90s games, where 100 players fight to remain the last alive. The game starts with each player parachuting from a plane onto the map. Players spawn with no gear, and must loot buildings, towns, and other places to find weapons. The items are randomly distributed, but higher-risk areas generally have better equipment. Every few minutes the playable area shrinks as a damaging "storm" progresses towards the safe zone. This forces players to actually fight others, instead of hiding to try and win. Throughout the game, planes fly above and drop boxes with rare loot. These boxes have visible red smoke, drawing players near it and causing more engagements.    </p>
